# QuantLib Python examples

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lballabio/QuantLib-SWIG/binder?filepath=Python%2Fexamples)

This directory contains a number of examples of using QuantLib from
Python.  They can also run as Jupyter notebooks by means of
[Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/).

You can try them without installing QuantLib on your computer; they
are available on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) at
[https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lballabio/QuantLib-SWIG/binder?filepath=Python%2Fexamples](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lballabio/QuantLib-SWIG/binder?filepath=Python%2Fexamples)
(or you can click the "Launch Binder" badge at the top of this file).

If you want to run these examples locally, you'll need the modules listed in the
`requirements.txt` file at the root of the [QuantLib-SWIG
repository](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib-SWIG); to install
them, you can execute

    pip install -r requirements.txt

from that directory.
